    "Ensemble of Decision Trees:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Like the Random Forest for classification, the Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble of decision trees.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is obtained by averaging the predictions of all individual trees.\r\n",
    "Averaging helps smooth out the impact of individual noisy predictions and outliers, reducing the overall variance of the model.\r\n",
    "It acts as a form of regularization, preventing the model from fitting the training data too closely.\r\n",
    "Ensemble Learning:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm, meaning it combines predictions from multiple models.\r\n",
    "The ensemble nature of the algorithm allows it to capture a more robust and generalizable pattern in the data by leveraging the collective knowledge of multiple trees.\r\n",
    "Individual trees might make errors, but the ensemble tends to be more accurate, especially on unseen data.\r\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor has hyperparameters that can be tuned to control the complexity of the individual trees and the overall ensemble.\r\n",
    "For example, limiting the maximum depth of each tree (max_depth) or setting a minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (min_samples_split) can help control the model's capacity and reduce overfitting."
